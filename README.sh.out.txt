__ NVIDIA __
Use of NVIDIA hardware may require users to have an internet connection or similar convenience to download and run theirselves.

A syscall exception may be what allows distribution of NVIDIA proprietary binary Linux modules at all. Or, so long as NVIDIA can dubiously claim their proprietary binary Linux kernel module may not be a derived work of a GPLv2 licensed Linux kernel, NVIDIA may argue that an &#39;attempt otherwise to&#39; &#39;sublicense&#39; the Linux kernel has not occurred, and thus NVIDIA may claim their rights did not yet &#39;automatically terminate&#39;. Seemingly, the absence of distribution of LiveCD/LiveUSB images with NVIDIA drivers included and installed suggests the open-source community does not find any such arguments compelling. Yet, while there apparently have been US court cases involving the GPLv2 copyright license, the NVIDIA proprietary kernel driver issue has apparently not been raised as of 2022.

Meanwhile, Soaring Distributions LLC is at least reluctant if not unwilling to itself distribute binary Linux kernel modules.


If Soaring Distributions LLC distributes software which users may run to receive and run software from third-party distributors (eg. if Soaring Distributions provides a script to download and run NVIDIA proprietary drivers), and if this is perceived as some issue, any &#39;cease-and-desist&#39; should be sent directly to those third party distributors (ie. NVIDIA, Debian, Ubuntu, OEMs, etc), NOT to Soaring Distributions LLC itself. Soaring Distributions LLC may not yet on its own be able to prove, but does not discount, that those distributors (ie. at least NVIDIA) may be coercively, flagrantly, willfully, exploiting for commercial gain, to the extent of many years and multiple billions of dollars, violating the GPLv2 copyright license of the Linux kernel.

To the extent legally possible, Soaring Distributions LLC should be reasonably expected to publish, and specifically make relevant third-parties aware of, any such notices.

	&#39;But, if the driver doesn&#39;t directly link to the kernel, that may not apply. I remember in the past some graphics drivers (I think NVidia, but aren&#39;t sure) had two parts. One GPL-part included in the kernel and offering an interface for the second part, that was proprietary. I don&#39;t know how legally stable this construct is, but it may work.&#39;
