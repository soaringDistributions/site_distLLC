'We use the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Public Domain License every time an artist uploads a piece of clipart to Openclipart to make it clear the artist is releasing the creative work for anyone to use for any reason, even commercially. This act of "sharing" is the foundation Openclipart is based upon. Sometimes people want a disclaimer or legal assurance that our clipart is safe to be used. This extra security request often comes from people working for companies of all sizes and, or, publishers.
